Trump is obviously trying to use tarrifs.  Democrats have favored an approach of working with the global community to force China to play by the rules, but I don’t know the strategy for doing that and/or if any progress was ever made on that front.

It seems like your question isn't so much 'is conscription justified?' but rather 'should it be done in a better way?'

"If conscription is justified from a practical standpoint - the country will fall without it and more citizens will die than would be conscripted - then it is morally justified as well.

The primary difference is that it was Biden and it's now Trump.

"echoing this: Why would it be impossible for an all female staff to run a hotel?

As to the premise- it really depends on the circumstances whether or not gender segregation of this nature is like feminist in any way - I think in a context where women can't safely go to a co-ed staffed hotel or male-run hotel for some reason, or where women can't safely work at a co-staffed hotel etc. than segregated hotels might make some sort of sense as a corrective action.

Long term I don't think feminism really celebrates gender segregation as a solution for sexism - in general I think 'separate but equal' is a policy failure and does nothing to address underlying biases or prejudices - if men and women can't work or live together in most public environments that really suggests there are some persistent underlying problems.

The ‘MRA’ types whining about this are of a generation where this disparity won’t apply.

"I think unfortunately too many kids are now learning the power of plausible deniability/no accountability due to a variety of social awareness campaigns and unfortunately, the US presidency. 

My daughter had several kids in a group all body shame her and I reported it to the school as well as the identifiable kids parents. One of the kids has decided that in retaliation he is now making counter claims saying my child had been bullying him (there was zero claims of this prior to repercussions he got from me reporting him bullying her). Multiple kids corroborated claims of this kid yelling horrible things to her which is why the school was comfortable proceeding with corrective action, but now my daughters lesson learned is 'if you say what happened to you, be prepared to be accused of some crap.'

"All I can really give you is the fact that there are a lot of successful musicians who had parents who were either poor or unsupportive.

Whether TS specifically would have succeeded under those circumstances just comes down to the butterfly effect.

Everyone’s future is caused by the circumstances and events along the way, we don’t have a way of telling which ones were essential.

"You are right that she had a lot of privileges, that’s undeniable. But the vast majority of successful musicians also had major privileges. I wonder what level of privilege you’d draw the line at.

That being said, I think you may be overlooking just HOW successful Taylor is. Taylor had the same privileges as, say Paris Hilton (failed music career) or even a successful musician like Lana Del Ray, who isn’t nearly as successful as Taylor Swift.

Something else is happening here that sets Taylor apart. Even if it’s just tapping into a certain teen girl zeitgeist or successful marketing, that’s STILL a skill set.",ideologically_mild,0.4,0.2,0.1,0.3,0.5,0.2,0.1

"First, there is a difference between being cautious of a specific neighborhood or area and cautious of a specific race. Like if you don’t want to visit a dangerous country due to crime reported in that area, that is fair. But to avoid or be cautious of an entire race is upholding prejudice and upholding racial biases that have negative effects in the world. Additionally it isn’t entirely logical. Even if the statistical chance of them committing a crime is higher, the statistical chance of a crime happening at that given time and given location is normally low enough that it is negligible. The race of the people you pass / interact with generally has a negligible effect on whether a crime will statistically happen to you specifically.",ideologically_mild,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1,0.5,0.2,0.1
"Just because you believe a form of discrimination of any sort is justified does not mean that it is either not discrimination or not harmful.

>To illustrate this dilemma with a metaphor: Imagine you are given two bowls of jelly beans. One bowl has a 5% chance of containing a toxic jelly bean, while the other has a 20% chance. If you hesitate before picking from the riskier bowl, does that make you prejudiced? Or is it simply an instinctive response to minimize risk?

Are you treating the bowls of jelly beans differently from one another? If the answer is yes, you are discriminating between the bowls of jelly beans.

>I’m really get at isn’t blatant discrimation against other races because we feel “scared” of them and start justifying not renting to them

"What you're describing is quite literally the definition of prejudice. Prejudice stands for ""pre-judging"", meaning formulating a judgement in advance.

Statistics or not, being wary of someone you don't know is inherently a form of prejudice, because you've formulated a judgement based on your preconceived notions instead of information you gain at the moment.

Ok you are making adverse judgments about people based on race. In this case you are saying that they represent a greater risk of certain crimes based on data associated with people of the race.

"Human beings are pattern recognition filters.   That's what we do.  We're really good at it, it's one of the biggest reasons why we have survived and thrived:  because we can recognize patterns, predict the likely outcome from analyzing them,  and adapt our behavior accordingly.

""Bias"" is simply recognizing a pattern and using it to predict the next step.   Are we right 100% of the time?  No.   But by analyzing the data that you have, you can predict likely patterns.  

Cops have to deal with resisting the urge to racially profile all the time.  It's hard to resist the instinct to recognize patterns when you've responded to 46 armed robbery calls in the last two months and in every single one of them the suspect has been described by witnesses as a ""young Black man"", then call number 47 comes in and who do you predict the suspect will be?
