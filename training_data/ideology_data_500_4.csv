"How would it be ""impossible"" for a hotel to be run with all-female staff?

I don't know that it ""creates opportunities for women,"" necessarily, but it may indeed make women feel much safer staying in hotels, particularly alone.

I think a lot of people don't realize that there's still a line to ride as far as advancing gender equality and ensuring women's safety and comfort, and pretending like we already have it isn't really productive.",ideologically_mild,0.3,0.2,0.1,0.2,0.4,0.5,0.1
"echoing this: Why would it be impossible for an all female staff to run a hotel?

As to the premise- it really depends on the circumstances whether or not gender segregation of this nature is like feminist in any way - I think in a context where women can't safely go to a co-ed staffed hotel or male-run hotel for some reason, or where women can't safely work at a co-staffed hotel etc. than segregated hotels might make some sort of sense as a corrective action.

Long term I don't think feminism really celebrates gender segregation as a solution for sexism - in general I think 'separate but equal' is a policy failure and does nothing to address underlying biases or prejudices - if men and women can't work or live together in most public environments that really suggests there are some persistent underlying problems.

I would argue that we actually need sex discrimination in order to empower women. The human world was built by and for men. Men hold the vast majority of economic, political, and social power. They also commit the vast majority of violent and sexual crimes. There is nothing wrong with carving out small spaces that are just for women -- bathrooms, locker rooms, sports, clubs, businesses, etc.

Yes, the idea behind this all-female hotel is feminist. Not only because it helps the employment of women, but also because it puts a mirror in front of men's faces.
