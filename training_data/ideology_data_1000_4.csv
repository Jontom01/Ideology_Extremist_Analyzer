Yes this is deliberate and yes they are comparing full frontal male nudity as equal to a womans breasts.

I don’t know the facts but I heard that there are people on Hollywood sets that will advocate for actresses and make changes to scenes if the nudity is not warranted. I wonder if they advocate for actors also? My guess is that its probably equivalent to the health care industry where a women can request female nurses and staff for intimate procedures and the request will be granted.

They should do appropriate follow up, and there's no way for them to know you took anything.

As to the premise- it really depends on the circumstances whether or not gender segregation of this nature is like feminist in any way - I think in a context where women can't safely go to a co-ed staffed hotel or male-run hotel for some reason, or where women can't safely work at a co-staffed hotel etc. than segregated hotels might make some sort of sense as a corrective action.

Long term I don't think feminism really celebrates gender segregation as a solution for sexism - in general I think ""separate but equal"" is a policy failure and does nothing to address underlying biases or prejudices - if men and women can't work or live together in most public environments that really suggests there are some persistent underlying problems.

Yes, the idea behind this all-female hotel is feminist. Not only because it helps the employment of women, but also because it puts a mirror in front of men's faces. How many claim that male-only spaces were never an issue? How many claim they are, in fact, *still needed*? Now they're getting the littlest taste of their medicine *and* it helps women, both hosts and guests, feel safer. For me it's a win win.",ideologically_intermediate,0.4,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.6,0.3

"The reasoning is it’s from back in the day when most people were married, and husbands tend to be a few years older than wives, so this way they’d retire more or less together. The other reason was women are the vast majority of carers. This is the time when parents & older relatives are dying and in most countries, women make up 85% of unpaid carers, same as most of them would have hardly any retirement funds anyhow, since they would have brought up their kids and looked after grandkids.

"People say it benefits women because it emerged from a conservative benevolent sexism, but the real reason is economic: a lot of these countries keep large percentages of their female population permanently unemployed doing domestic work or underemployed doing piecework/part time work. There just aren't jobs for them to retire from in a traditional manner, so the state has them retire early into a kind of state subsidized poverty where they become full time family caregivers.

So yeah, grandma gets to retire a little earlier than grandpa.  She fought hard so her granddaughter had the same opportunities as her grandson, on top of working and doing most of the domestic work.  The ‘MRA’ types whining about this are of a generation where this disparity won’t apply.
