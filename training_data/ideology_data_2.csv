"There will not be evidence that the US has been ripped off or not because (1) it is a value judgment not a fact and (2) the effects of these deals are complex and require deep deep study by scientists and economic analysts. International trade is not zero sum, and it's not simple. There will be some losers even if the net value is positive. So Trump can claim the US got ripped off by pointing to a loser in a specific trade that he feels bad for. Trump could provide some evidence for a specific downside of a trade deal but that won't mean *you* agree it's the right interpretation, because there is likely to be an upside that maybe you value more than Trump does.

"echoing this: Why would it be impossible for an all female staff to run a hotel?

As to the premise- it really depends on the circumstances whether or not gender segregation of this nature is like feminist in any way - I think in a context where women can't safely go to a co-ed staffed hotel or male-run hotel for some reason, or where women can't safely work at a co-staffed hotel etc. than segregated hotels might make some sort of sense as a corrective action.

Long term I don't think feminism really celebrates gender segregation as a solution for sexism - in general I think ""separate but equal"" is a policy failure and does nothing to address underlying biases or prejudices - if men and women can't work or live together in most public environments that really suggests there are some persistent underlying problems.

As a single hotel in a single place, it seems more like a PR move than a meaningful political statement.",0.4,0.3,0.2,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.1
"How would it be ""impossible"" for a hotel to be run with all-female staff?

I don't know that it ""creates opportunities for women,"" necessarily, but it may indeed make women feel much safer staying in hotels, particularly alone.

I think a lot of people don't realize that there's still a line to ride as far as advancing gender equality and ensuring women's safety and comfort, and pretending like we already have it isn't really productive.",0.4,0.3,0.2,0.1,0.5,0.4,0.2

"My family has been going on vacation to the same place every single summer since about 1952. The staff, from top to bottom, is made of women.

The only exception is for the husband of the hotel owner, who ambles about the entrance and, when you get there, asks if you want him to park your car. He's also in charge of organizing Sunday cocktail hour.

Yes, the idea behind this all-female hotel is feminist. Not only because it helps the employment of women, but also because it puts a mirror in front of men's faces. How many claim that male-only spaces were never an issue? How many claim they are, in fact, *still needed*?

"I think it is really important to stop framing the goal of feminism as 'gender equality' or 'treat everyone the same' or 'no sex discrimination.' I would argue that we actually need sex discrimination in order to empower women. The human world was built by and for men. Men hold the vast majority of economic, political, and social power. They also commit the vast majority of violent and sexual crimes. There is nothing wrong with carving out small spaces that are just for women -- bathrooms, locker rooms, sports, clubs, businesses, etc. If people are saying that women cannot run a hotel, all the more reason to have one staffed entirely by women.",0.7,0.5,0.4,0.5,0.6,0.5,0.3
"The reasoning is it’s from back in the day when most people were married, and husbands tend to be a few years older than wives, so this way they’d retire more or less together. The other reason was women are the vast majority of carers.

And no- feminists had nothing to do with it.",0.4,0.2,0.3,0.1,0.5,0.2,0.1
"People say it benefits women because it emerged from a conservative benevolent sexism, but the real reason is economic: a lot of these countries keep large percentages of their female population permanently unemployed doing domestic work or underemployed doing piecework/part time work. There just aren't jobs for them to retire from in a traditional manner, so the state has them retire early into a kind of state subsidized poverty where they become full time family caregivers. Not to mention those checks are often recouped by the male head of household.

 It really is a symptom of an economic system that systematically excludes and discriminates against women.

"If you look at these laws, the difference in retirement ages is generally temporary and by the time a 35 year old woman now gets to retirement, it will be the same age as her husband.  The different retirement ages for older generations is about recognizing the various gender disparities at play in their lives.  Those different retirement ages tend to be very generation specific.

So yeah, grandma gets to retire a little earlier than grandpa.  She fought hard so her granddaughter had the same opportunities as her grandson, on top of working and doing most of the domestic work.  The ‘MRA’ types whining about this are of a generation where this disparity won’t apply.  The grandpas retiring are not the ones complaining, as they had a ring side seat to all that their wives did for them and all their sisters did for the family as a whole, and they get it.",0.4,0.5,0.5,0.3,0.6,0.4,0.2

At the same time, I don't think deemphasizing relationships is the exact right way to move. I think human connection is really important and that people don't really function well alone. That is to say, I think part of incel mindset isn't just from society, but part of it is the internal frustration and loneliness associated with not being in a relationship.

So, while I don't completely disagree from what you've written, I think it's important to emphasize building relationships, whether they be romantic or platonic.",0.2,0.3,0.1,0.0,0.4,0.5,0.1

I get what you're saying but it won't change anything because incels don't want a girlfriend or sex because society tells them they want one; incels want a girlfriend because THEY want one. And saying it's 'ok to be perpetually single' isn't helpful it's actually a bit condescending. Just apply this logic to say finances. Imagine you're struggling with money stuck working a minimum wage job and always in debt and someone says 'it's okay to be poor!' Then high fives you and humming goes on their merry way. Would you say 'Golly Gee they're right it's OK to be poor!' Probably not it might make you feel a bit better for a moment but it doesn't fix your problem. Romantic human connection is a vital part of the human experience that the vast majority of the human race craves so just telling men what effectively amounts to 'just live without' isn't helpful.,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.4,0.3
"You're literally saying that to fight against incel ideology you have to teach men that **it's OK to never experience the love of a relationship in their lives**.

You'll see societies being burn to the ground **before** you'll convince someone that's feeling excluded from something so basic as experiencing a relationship that it's ok to never experience it.

""The excluded child will watch the village burn to at least once feel it's warmth"".

Wanna fight incel ideology?

- Stop treating them as a monolith : There can be N reasons for them to fail to get a girlfriend, and some of those aren't his fault.

- Work in solving the problem, not masking the symptoms : The problem is not being able to get a girlfriend.

It's an unnecessary distinction. I live in Canada where y'all is not commonly used and it's not a problem. There are whole languages out there with **no pluralized common nouns** (eg. the plural of sushi is sushi) and they get along based on context alone. I'd wager more English speakers globally do not use 'y'all' than do use it. If it's useful then its use would be more common.,0.4,0.2,0.1,0.0,0.3,0.2,0.1
It appears in the dictionary so it IS _an_ official plural form of _you._ But why designate as THE official form? That would make it exclusively correct and other words incorrect. That is not how languages work. There can be multiple correct ways to say something.,0.4,0.2,0.1,0.0,0.5,0.1,0.0
"I live in Australia. Nobody says ""y'all"". But some people might say ""youse"" (pronounced like ""use"") to mean the same thing. If we're going to have a plural version of you, then why should we go with y'all instead of youse? You might argue that more people live in the southern United States than Australia, so more English speakers say y'all than youse. But I would counter-argue that *vastly* more people say ""you"" as a plural, as it's the standard way to do it in the English language.
