"My family has been going on vacation to the same place every single summer since about 1952. The staff, from top to bottom, is made of women. Hotel manager, concierge, cooks, maids, accountants, *every single employed person* is a woman. The only exception is for the husband of the hotel owner, who ambles about the entrance and, when you get there, asks if you want him to park your car. He's also in charge of organizing Sunday cocktail hour.

Yes, the idea behind this all-female hotel is feminist. Not only because it helps the employment of women, but also because it puts a mirror in front of men's faces. How many claim that male-only spaces were never an issue? How many claim they are, in fact, *still needed*? Now they're getting the littlest taste of their medicine *and* it helps women, both hosts and guests, feel safer. For me it's a win win.",ideologically_moderate,0.4,0.5,0.3,0.5,0.6,0.4,0.2
"The reasoning is it‚Äôs from back in the day when most people were married, and husbands tend to be a few years older than wives, so this way they‚Äôd retire more or less together. The other reason was women are the vast majority of carers. This is the time when parents & older relatives are dying and in most countries, women make up 85% of unpaid carers, same as most of them would have hardly any retirement funds anyhow, since they would have brought up their kids and looked after grandkids.

"People say it benefits women because it emerged from a conservative benevolent sexism, but the real reason is economic: a lot of these countries keep large percentages of their female population permanently unemployed doing domestic work or underemployed doing piecework/part time work. There just aren't jobs for them to retire from in a traditional manner, so the state has them retire early into a kind of state subsidized poverty where they become full time family caregivers. Not to mention those checks are often recouped by the male head of household.

 It really is a symptom of an economic system that systematically excludes and discriminates against women.

So yeah, grandma gets to retire a little earlier than grandpa.

The ‚ÄòMRA‚Äô types whining about this are of a generation where this disparity won‚Äôt apply.

"""Y'all"" is a shibboleth used to distinguish and identify people from the southern US. Others adopting it creates difficulty for them when it comes to forming and maintaining group identity.

My solution is to use ""you all,"" no contraction. I'm not alone in this choice. We have a lot of people from the US south in my state, so the shift works smoothly.

This is far better than using  ""you guys"" or ""guys,"" which I see you did in this post, ironic.

"So, a good chunk of home-auto insurance companies have been losing money lately. Their payouts exceed the premiums they take in. This means they‚Äôre doing the opposite of what you‚Äôre claiming. They‚Äôre undercharging, not over charging, and not denying that many claims relatively speaking.",ideologically_moderate,0.3,0.2,0.2,0.0,0.3,0.1,0.1
">1 - there is an immense amount of profit being made, which sucks money out of the pool that *should* be used to pay for claims

Margins are like 3% for insurance companies

>the ability for a company to deny coverage to people based on risk means that the core concept of WHY people have insurance is bullshit (you pay a premium so that you can get support if you need it, but then you might get denied support entirely if the amount you need is too high? THAT'S WHY YOU HAVE INSURANCE!!!)

You're mixing up a few things. If you deny someone coverage due to risk you **aren't** providing them with insurance. You aren't collecting premiums.


What you are covered for is calculated into your premium. If I want to be covered for up to $1,000,000 I'm going to pay more than if I'm covered up to $50,000.",ideologically_moderate,0.7,0.5,0.4,0.2,0.6,0.2,0.3
">1 - there is an immense amount of profit being made, which sucks money out of the pool that should be used to pay for claims

There are multiple nonprofit insurance companies. The rates aren't much different than those of the for profit companies. 

>2 - the ability for a company to deny coverage to people based on risk means that the core concept of WHY people have insurance is bullshit

Once the policy is in place, a claim can't just be denied and the policy can't just be canceled. 

>3 - since these are mandatory (more or less, in the United States)

Only liability car insurance is mandatory. The penalty for not having health insurance was repealed. You only are required to have insurance on your home or collision on your car if you have a mortgage/loan.",ideologically_moderate,0.5,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.4,0.2,0.3

I think you have to be more precise in what positions you're ascribing to people. Nobody that I'm aware of who is 'anti transplants' thinks that people should *not be allowed to move to NYC*. They just don't like transplants and find them annoying. But that's not really the same thing as what we're typically talking about with immigration. Its entirely plausible that someone could be deeply racist on a personal level while still recognizing economic value of immigration. They can be 'pro immigration' as a policy position while still not actually wanting to be around immigrants.,ideologically_moderate,0.4,0.3,0.2,0.0,0.3,0.2,0.1

"I understand where you're coming from, but I think you're conflating two things that are of completely different degrees of seriousness. Native New Yorkers complain about transplants, but we're not deporting them. We're not committing hate crimes against them. How would that even work? Am I gonna go find someone with a Brooklyn Nets hat who looks like they're from Ohio? I'm a native New Yorker, I might make a joke about it, but most of my friends are transplants, it's not that serious. We're not marching in the streets, blaming transplants for all the rapes and murders, it's just not a very real issue. Anti-immigrant sentiment actually has serious material effects on the lives of human beings and is a major force in American politics. It's not just a few people on Reddit complaining, people are being abducted off the streets and sent to prison camps without due process.
